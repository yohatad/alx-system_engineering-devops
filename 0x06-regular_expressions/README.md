**REGULAR EXPRESSIONS**

It's a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.
The search patterns are used in string-search algorithm for 'find' or 'find and replace'

Regular expressions somewhat differs from langauge to language.

In this program, the regular expressions used are of the Ruby language which uses the Oniuguruma library.

I've used Rubular, a Ruby regular expression editor to test and match regular expression with string.
